1. Get the number and convert it to the array of characters to loop through.

2. At the time of looping convert the number 6 to 9 ( Now there is one thing that why we are only converting 6 to 9 why not 9 to 6 it is because if we want to get the largest number we just need to convert the 6 to 9).

3. After all this process return the string (The string which we will get by converting array to string).
